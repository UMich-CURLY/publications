  abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to
	maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either
	rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting
	conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from
	an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided
	invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups
	and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics
	with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with
	all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear
	autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the
	observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that
	is independent of the system’s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither
	the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the
	current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties
	and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear
	system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts,
	and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence
	of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter
	(EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot.
	Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment
	provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides
	better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting
	symmetries present in system.},

  abstract  = {We propose a sampling-based motion-planning algorithm equipped with an information-theoretic convergence criterion for incremental informative motion planning. The proposed approach allows dense map representations and incorporates the full state uncertainty into the planning process. The problem is formulated as a constrained maximization problem. Our approach is built on rapidly exploring information-gathering algorithms and benefits from the advantages of sampling-based optimal motion-planning algorithms. We propose two information functions and their variants for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence for an entire exploration and information-gathering mission based on the least upper bound of the average map entropy. A natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control results from the convergence analysis. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms using three scenarios: comparison of the proposed information functions and sensor configuration selection, robotic exploration in unknown environments, and a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake from a publicly available dataset collected using an autonomous surface vehicle.},

  abstract = {An accurate characterization of pose uncertainty is essential for safe
	autonomous navigation. Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed
	by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman (SCC), used coordinate-based first-order methods
	to propagate uncertainty through non-linear functions such as pose composition
	(head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail).
	Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra of the special Euclidean group
	results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing approaches assume
	that individual poses are independent. Since factors in a pose graph induce
	correlation, this independence assumption is usually not reflected in reality.
	In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation.
	This paper develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed
	poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the SSC pose operations while
	characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source
	datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates.
	An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released.},

  abstract = {The essence of most shape registration algorithms is to find correspondences
	between two point clouds and then to solve for a rigid body transformation that
	aligns the geometry. The main drawback is that the point clouds are obtained by
	placing the sensor at different views; consequently, the two matched points most
	likely do not correspond to the same physical point in the real environment. In other
	words, the point cloud is a discrete representation of the shape geometry. Alternatively,
	a point cloud measurement can be seen as samples from geometry, and a function can be learned
	for a continuous representation using regression techniques such as kernel methods. 
	To boost registration algorithms, this work develops a novel class of regularizers modeled
	in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) that ensures correspondences are also 
	consistent in an abstract vector space of functions such as intensity surface.
	Furthermore, the proposed RKHS regularizer is agnostic to the choice of the registration
	cost function which is desirable. The evaluations on experimental data confirm the

  abstract  = {The purpose of this study is to suggest and examine a PI–fuzzy path planner and associated low-level control system for a linear discrete dynamic model of omni-directional mobile robots to obtain optimal inputs for drivers. Velocity and acceleration filtering is also implemented in the path planner to satisfy planning prerequisites and prevent slippage. Regulated drivers’ rotational velocities and torques greatly affect the ability of these robots to perform trajectory planner tasks. These regulated values are examined in this research by setting up an optimal controller. Introducing optimal controllers such as linear quadratic tracking for multi-input–multi-output control systems in acceleration and deceleration is one of the essential subjects for motion control of omni-directional mobile robots. The main topics presented and discussed in this article are improvements in the presented discrete-time linear quadratic tracking approach such as the low-level controller and combined PI–fuzzy path planner with appropriate speed monitoring algorithm such as the high-level one in conditions both with and without external disturbance. The low-level tracking controller presented in this article provides an optimal solution to minimize the differences between the reference trajectory and the system output. The efficiency of this approach is also compared with that of previous PID controllers which employ kinematic modeling. Utilizing the new approach in trajectory-planning controller design results in more precise and appropriate outputs for the motion of four-wheeled omni-directional mobile robots, and the modeling and experimental results confirm this issue.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel mechanism to initiate new views within the map building process for an EKF-based visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) approach using omnidirectional images. In presence of non-linearities, the EKF is very likely to compromise the final estimation. Particularly, the omnidirectional observation model induces non-linear errors, thus it becomes a potential source of uncertainty. To deal with this issue we propose a novel mechanism for view initialization which accounts for information gain and losses more efficiently. The main outcome of this contribution is the reduction of the map uncertainty and thus the higher consistency of the final estimation. Its basis relies on a Gaussian Process to infer an information distribution model from sensor data. This model represents feature points existence probabilities and their information content analysis leads to the proposed view initialization scheme. To demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the approach we present a series of real data experiments conducted with a robot equipped with a camera sensor and map model solely based on omnidirectional views. The results reveal a beneficial reduction on the uncertainty but also on the error in the pose and the map estimate.}

  abstract  = {Most of the existing robotic exploration schemes use occupancy grid representations and geometric targets known as frontiers. The occupancy grid representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop a Gaussian processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is computationally tractable for online map building due to its incremental formulation and provides a continuous model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates. The standard way to represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel probabilistic frontier maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP occupancy map. We also propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration technique built on that representation that takes into account all possible future observations. A major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the fact that such techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map entropy reduction during exploration for map building scenarios. Evaluations using the publicly available datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed framework for robotic mapping and exploration tasks.},

There are two classes of occupancy mapping problems that we particularly investigate. The first problem is related to mapping under pose uncertainty and how to propagate pose estimation uncertainty into the map inference. We develop expected kernel and expected submap notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robot's perception noise using warped Gaussian processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the map quality.},
