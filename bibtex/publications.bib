  abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to
	maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either
	rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting
	conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from
	an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided
	invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups
	and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics
	with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with
	all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear
	autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the
	observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that
	is independent of the systemâ€™s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither
	the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the
	current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties
	and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear
	system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts,
	and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence
	of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter
	(EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot.
	Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment
	provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides
	better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting
	symmetries present in system.},

  abstract = {The factor graph framework is a convenient modeling technique for
	robotic state estimation where states are represented as nodes, and
	measurements are modeled as factors. When designing a sensor fusion
	framework for legged robots, one often has access to visual, inertial,
	joint encoder, and contact sensors. While visual-inertial odometry
	has been studied extensively in this framework, the addition of a
	preintegrated contact factor for legged robots has been only recently
	proposed. This allowed for integration of encoder and contact measurements
	into existing factor graphs, however, new nodes had to be added to
	the graph every time contact was made or broken. In this work, to
	cope with the problem of switching contact frames, we propose a hybrid
	contact preintegration theory that allows contact information to
	be integrated through an arbitrary number of contact switches. The
	proposed hybrid modeling approach reduces the number of required
	variables in the nonlinear optimization problem by only requiring
	new states to be added alongside camera or selected keyframes. This
	method is evaluated using real experimental data collected from a
	Cassie-series robot where the trajectory of the robot produced by
	a motion capture system is used as a proxy for ground truth. The
	evaluation shows that inclusion of the proposed preintegrated hybrid
	contact factor alongside visual-inertial navigation systems improves
	estimation accuracy as well as robustness to vision failure, while
	its generalization makes it more accessible for legged platforms.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a novel formulation and evaluation of visual 
	odometry from RGB-D images. Assuming a static scene, the developed theoretical
	framework generalizes the widely used direct energy formulation (photometric 
	error minimization) technique for obtaining a rigid body transformation that 
	aligns two overlapping RGB-D images to a continuous formulation. The continuity
	is achieved through functional treatment of the problem and representing the 
	process models over RGB-D images in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space; consequently,
	the registration is not limited to the specific image resolution and the framework
	is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the gradient. We solve the
	problem by maximizing the inner product between two functions defined over RGB-D
	images, while the continuous action of the rigid body motion Lie group is captured
	through the integration of the flow in the corresponding Lie algebra. Energy-based
	approaches have been extremely successful and the developed framework in this paper
	shares many of their desired properties such as the parallel structure on both CPUs
	and GPUs, sparsity, semi-dense tracking, avoiding explicit data association which is
	computationally expensive, and possible extensions to the simultaneous localization
	and mapping frameworks. The evaluations on experimental data and comparison with
	the equivalent energy-based formulation of the problem confirm the effectiveness
	of the proposed technique, especially, when the lack of structure and texture in
	the environment is evident.},

  abstract = {This paper derives a contact-aided inertial navigation observer for
	a 3D bipedal robot using the theory of invariant observer design.
	Aided inertial navigation is fundamentally a nonlinear observer design
	problem; thus, current solutions are based on approximations of the
	system dynamics, such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which uses
	a system's Jacobian linearization along the current best estimate
	of its trajectory. On the basis of the theory of invariant observer
	design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the Invariant EKF
	(InEKF), we show that the error dynamics of the point contact-inertial
	system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation; hence,
	the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a
	domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory.
	Due to the log-linear form of the error dynamics, it is not necessary
	to perform a nonlinear observability analysis to show that when using
	an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and contact sensors, the absolute
	position of the robot and a rotation about the gravity vector (yaw)
	are unobservable. We further augment the state of the developed InEKF
	with IMU biases, as the online estimation of these parameters has
	a crucial impact on system performance. We evaluate theconvergence
	of the proposed system with the commonly used quaternion-based EKF
	observer using a Monte-Carlo simulation. In addition, our experimental
	evaluation using a Cassie-series bipedal robot shows that the contact-aided
	InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based
	EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in the system dynamics.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art robotic perception systems have achieved sufficiently
	good performance using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), cameras,
	and nonlinear optimization techniques, that they are now being deployed
	as technologies. However, many of these methods rely significantly
	on vision and often fail when visual tracking is lost due to lighting
	or scarcity of features. This paper presents a state-estimation technique
	for legged robots that takes into account the robot's kinematic model
	as well as its contact with the environment. We introduce forward
	kinematic factors and preintegrated contact factors into a factor
	graph framework that can be incrementally solved in real-time. The
	forward kinematic factor relates the robot's base pose to a contact
	frame through noisy encoder measurements. The preintegrated contact
	factor provides odometry measurements of this contact frame while
	accounting for possible foot slippage. Together, the two developed
	factors constrain the graph optimization problem allowing the robot's
	trajectory to be estimated. The paper evaluates the method using
	simulated and real sensory IMU and kinematic data from experiments
	with a Cassie-series robot designed by Agility Robotics. These preliminary
	experiments show that using the proposed method in addition to IMU
	decreases drift and improves localization accuracy, suggesting that
	its use can enable successful recovery from a loss of visual tracking.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a high-dimensional map building technique
	that incorporates raw pixelated semantic measurements into the map
	representation. The proposed technique uses Gaussian Processes (GPs)
	multi-class classification for map inference and is the natural extension
	of GP occupancy maps from binary to multi-class form. The technique
	exploits the continuous property of GPs and, as a result, the map
	can be inferred with any resolution. In addition, the proposed GP
	Semantic Map (GPSM) learns the structural and semantic correlation
	from measurements rather than resorting to assumptions, and can flexibly
	learn the spatial correlation as well as any additional non-spatial
	correlation between map points. We extend the OctoMap to Semantic
	OctoMap representation and compare with the GPSM mapping performance
	using NYU Depth V2 dataset. Evaluations of the proposed technique

  abstract = {An accurate characterization of pose uncertainty is essential for safe
	autonomous navigation. Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed
	by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman (SCC), used coordinate-based first-order methods
	to propagate uncertainty through non-linear functions such as pose composition
	(head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail).
	Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra of the special Euclidean group
	results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing approaches assume
	that individual poses are independent. Since factors in a pose graph induce
	correlation, this independence assumption is usually not reflected in reality.
	In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation.
	This paper develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed
	poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the SSC pose operations while
	characterizing uncertainty in the Lie Algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source
	datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates.
	An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released.},

	the independent grid assumption and brings smoothness and continuity to the map inference,

  volume = {4},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {The essence of most shape registration algorithms is to find correspondences
	between two point clouds and then to solve for a rigid body transformation that
	aligns the geometry. The main drawback is that the point clouds are obtained by
	placing the sensor at different views; consequently, the two matched points most
	likely do not correspond to the same physical point in the real environment. In other
	words, the point cloud is a discrete representation of the shape geometry. Alternatively,
	a point cloud measurement can be seen as samples from geometry, and a function can be learned
	for a continuous representation using regression techniques such as kernel methods. 
	To boost registration algorithms, this work develops a novel class of regularizers modeled
	in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) that ensures correspondences are also 
	consistent in an abstract vector space of functions such as intensity surface.
	Furthermore, the proposed RKHS regularizer is agnostic to the choice of the registration
	cost function which is desirable. The evaluations on experimental data confirm the
