  abstract = {Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to
	maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either
	rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting
	conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from
	an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided
	invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups
	and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics
	with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with
	all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear
	autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the

The proposed approach allows dense map representations and incorporates the full state uncertainty into the planning process. The problem is formulated as a constrained maximization problem. Our approach is built on rapidly exploring information-gathering algorithms and benefits from the advantages of sampling-based optimal motion-planning algorithms. We propose two information functions and their variants for fast and online computations. We prove an information-theoretic convergence for an entire exploration and information-gathering mission based on the least upper bound of the average map entropy. A natural automatic stopping criterion for information-driven motion control results from the convergence analysis. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms using three scenarios: comparison of the proposed information functions and sensor configuration selection, robotic exploration in unknown environments, and a wireless signal strength monitoring task in a lake from a publicly available dataset collected using an autonomous surface vehicle.},

Velocity and acceleration filtering is also implemented in the path planner to satisfy planning prerequisites and prevent slippage. Regulated drivers’ rotational velocities and torques greatly affect the ability of these robots to perform trajectory planner tasks. These regulated values are examined in this research by setting up an optimal controller. Introducing optimal controllers such as linear quadratic tracking for multi-input–multi-output control systems in acceleration and deceleration is one of the essential subjects for motion control of omni-directional mobile robots. The main topics presented and discussed in this article are improvements in the presented discrete-time linear quadratic tracking approach such as the low-level controller and combined PI–fuzzy path planner with appropriate speed monitoring algorithm such as the high-level one in conditions both with and without external disturbance. The low-level tracking controller presented in this article provides an optimal solution to minimize the differences between the reference trajectory and the system output. The efficiency of this approach is also compared with that of previous PID controllers which employ kinematic modeling. Utilizing the new approach in trajectory-planning controller design results in more precise and appropriate outputs for the motion of four-wheeled omni-directional mobile robots, and the modeling and experimental results confirm this issue.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a novel mechanism to initiate new views within the map building process for an EKF-based visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) approach using omnidirectional images. In presence of non-linearities, the EKF is very likely to compromise the final estimation. Particularly, the omnidirectional observation model induces non-linear errors, thus it becomes a potential source of uncertainty. To deal with this issue we propose a novel mechanism for view initialization which accounts for information gain and losses more efficiently. The main outcome of this contribution is the reduction of the map uncertainty and thus the higher consistency of the final estimation. Its basis relies on a Gaussian Process to infer an information distribution model from sensor data. This model represents feature points existence probabilities and their information content analysis leads to the proposed view initialization scheme. To demonstrate the suitability and effectiveness of the approach we present a series of real data experiments conducted with a robot equipped with a camera sensor and map model solely based on omnidirectional views. The results reveal a beneficial reduction on the uncertainty but also on the error in the pose and the map estimate.},

The occupancy grid representation relies on the assumption of independence between grid cells and ignores structural correlations present in the environment. We develop a Gaussian processes (GPs) occupancy mapping technique that is computationally tractable for online map building due to its incremental formulation and provides a continuous model of uncertainty over the map spatial coordinates. The standard way to represent geometric frontiers extracted from occupancy maps is to assign binary values to each grid cell. We extend this notion to novel probabilistic frontier maps computed efficiently using the gradient of the GP occupancy map. We also propose a mutual information-based greedy exploration technique built on that representation that takes into account all possible future observations. A major advantage of high-dimensional map inference is the fact that such techniques require fewer observations, leading to a faster map entropy reduction during exploration for map building scenarios.

We develop expected kernel and expected submap notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robot's perception noise using warped Gaussian processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs improve the map quality.},

  abstract  = {An accurate characterization of pose uncertainty is essential for safe autonomous navigation. Early pose uncertainty characterization methods proposed by Smith, Self, and Cheeseman (SCC) used coordinate-based first-order methods to propagate uncertainty through nonlinear functions such as pose composition (head-to-tail), pose inversion, and relative pose extraction (tail-to-tail). Characterizing uncertainty in the Lie algebra of the special Euclidean group results in better uncertainty estimates. However, existing Lie-group-based uncertainty propagation techniques assume that individual poses are independent. After solving a pose graph, however, the entire trajectory is jointly distributed as factors induce correlation. Hence, the independence assumption does not capture reality. In addition, prior work has focused primarily on the pose composition operation. This article develops a framework for modeling the uncertainty of jointly distributed poses and describes how to perform the equivalent of the SSC pose operations while characterizing uncertainty in the Lie algebra. Evaluation on simulated and open-source datasets shows that the proposed methods result in more accurate uncertainty estimates and thus more accurate filtering of potential loop closures. An accompanying C++ library implementation is also released.},

  abstract  = {Image-based fiducial markers are useful in problems such as object tracking in cluttered or textureless environments, camera (and multi-sensor) calibration tasks, and vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The state-of-the-art fiducial marker detection algorithms rely on the consistency of the ambient lighting. This article introduces LiDARTag, a novel fiducial tag design and detection algorithm suitable for light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The proposed method runs in real-time and can process data at 100 Hz, which is faster than the currently available LiDAR sensor frequencies. Because of the LiDAR sensors' nature, rapidly changing ambient lighting will not affect the detection of a LiDARTag; hence, the proposed fiducial marker can operate in a completely dark environment. In addition, the LiDARTag nicely complements and is compatible with existing visual fiducial markers, such as AprilTags, allowing for efficient multi-sensor fusion and calibration tasks. We further propose a concept of minimizing a fitting error between a point cloud and the marker's template to estimate the marker's pose. The proposed method achieves millimeter error in translation and a few degrees in rotation. Due to LiDAR returns' sparsity, the point cloud is lifted to a continuous function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the inner product can be used to determine a marker's ID. The experimental results, verified by a motion capture system, confirm that the proposed method can reliably provide a tag's pose and unique ID code. The rejection of false positives is validated on the Google Cartographer indoor dataset and the Honda H3D outdoor dataset.

Meanwhile, a probabilistic motion model predicts the pose based on a constant velocity assumption. The two estimated poses are finally fused using their uncertainties to yield an accurate pose prediction. This method leverages the geometric uncertainty and is applicable in indoor scenarios predominated by diffuse illumination. Experiments on simulation and real data sets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method.

It removes the need for a robot to access and process information from many separate maps when performing a complex task, advancing the way robots interact with their environments. To this end, we design a multitask deep neural network with attention mechanisms as our front-end to provide heterogeneous observations for multiple map layers simultaneously. Our back-end runs a scalable closed-form Bayesian inference with only logarithmic time complexity.

Traversability ground truth labels are automatically generated from exteroceptive sensory data in a self-supervised manner. We present extensive experimental results on publicly available datasets and data collected by a three-dimensional bipedal robot platform and show reliable mapping performance in different environments. Finally, we also discuss how the current framework can be extended to incorporate more information, such as friction, signal strength, temperature, and physical quantity concentration using Gaussian map layers.

  abstract = {This work presents a framework for multi-robot tour guidance in a partially known environment with uncertainty, such as a museum. In the proposed centralized multi-robot planner, a simultaneous matching and routing problem (SMRP) is formulated to match the humans with robot guides according to their selected places of interest (POIs) and generate the routes and schedules for the robots according to uncertain spatial and time estimation. A large neighborhood search algorithm is developed to efficiently find sub-optimal low-cost solutions for the SMRP. The scalability and optimality of the multi-robot planner are evaluated computationally under different numbers of humans, robots, and POIs. The largest case tested involves 50 robots, 250 humans, and 50 POIs. Then, a photo-realistic multi-robot simulation platform was developed based on Habitat-AI to verify the tour guiding performance in an uncertain indoor environment. Results demonstrate that the proposed centralized tour planner is scalable, makes a smooth tradeoff in the plans under different environmental constraints, and can lead to robust performance with inaccurate uncertainty estimations (within a certain margin).},

  abstract = {This paper develops a new mathematical framework that enables nonparametric joint semantic and geometric representation of continuous functions using data. The joint embedding is modeled by representing the processes in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The functions can be defined on arbitrary smooth manifolds where the action of a Lie group aligns them. The continuous functions allow the registration to be independent of a specific signal resolution. The framework is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the Riemannian gradient and Hessian. We study a more specialized but widely used case where the Lie group acts on functions isometrically. We solve the problem by maximizing the inner product between two functions defined over data, while the continuous action of the rigid body motion Lie group is captured through the integration of the flow in the corresponding Lie algebra. Low-dimensional cases are derived with numerical examples to show the generality of the proposed framework. The high-dimensional derivation for the special Euclidean group acting on the Euclidean space showcases the point cloud registration and bird's-eye view map registration abilities. An implementation of this framework for RGB-D cameras outperforms the state-of-the-art robust visual odometry and performs well in texture and structure-scarce environments.},

  abstract  = {WiFi technology has been used pervasively in fine-grained indoor localization,
	gesture recognition, and adaptive communication. Achieving better performance in these 
	tasks generally boils down to differentiating Line-Of-Sight (LOS) from Non-Line-Of-Sight
	(NLOS) signal propagation reliably which generally requires expensive/specialized 
	hardware due to the complex nature of indoor environments. Hence, the development of
	low-cost accurate positioning systems that exploit available infrastructure is not
	entirely solved. In this paper, we develop a framework for indoor localization and
	tracking of ubiquitous mobile devices such as smartphones using on-board sensors.
	We present a novel deep LOS/NLOS classifier which uses the Received Signal Strength
	Indicator (RSSI), and can classify the input signal with an accuracy of 85%. The proposed
	algorithm can globally localize and track a smartphone (or robot) with a priori unknown
	location, and with a semi-accurate prior map (error within 0.8m) of the WiFi Access Points
	(AP). Through simultaneously solving for the trajectory and the map of access points, we 
	recover a trajectory of the device and corrected locations for the access points.
	Experimental evaluations of the framework show that localization accuracy is increased by 
	using the trained deep network; furthermore, the system becomes robust to any error in
	the map of APs.},

  abstract  = {The factor graph framework is a convenient modeling technique for
	robotic state estimation where states are represented as nodes, and
	measurements are modeled as factors. When designing a sensor fusion
	framework for legged robots, one often has access to visual, inertial,
	joint encoder, and contact sensors. While visual-inertial odometry
	has been studied extensively in this framework, the addition of a
	preintegrated contact factor for legged robots has been only recently
	proposed. This allowed for integration of encoder and contact measurements
	into existing factor graphs, however, new nodes had to be added to
	the graph every time contact was made or broken. In this work, to
	cope with the problem of switching contact frames, we propose a hybrid
	contact preintegration theory that allows contact information to
	be integrated through an arbitrary number of contact switches. The
	proposed hybrid modeling approach reduces the number of required
	variables in the nonlinear optimization problem by only requiring
	new states to be added alongside camera or selected keyframes. This
	method is evaluated using real experimental data collected from a
	Cassie-series robot where the trajectory of the robot produced by
	a motion capture system is used as a proxy for ground truth. The
	evaluation shows that inclusion of the proposed preintegrated hybrid
	contact factor alongside visual-inertial navigation systems improves
	estimation accuracy as well as robustness to vision failure, while
	its generalization makes it more accessible for legged platforms.},

  abstract  = {This paper reports on a novel formulation and evaluation of visual

	framework generalizes the widely used direct energy formulation (photometric 
	error minimization) technique for obtaining a rigid body transformation that 
	aligns two overlapping RGB-D images to a continuous formulation. The continuity
	is achieved through functional treatment of the problem and representing the 
	process models over RGB-D images in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space; consequently,
	the registration is not limited to the specific image resolution and the framework
	is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the gradient. We solve the
	problem by maximizing the inner product between two functions defined over RGB-D
	images, while the continuous action of the rigid body motion Lie group is captured
	through the integration of the flow in the corresponding Lie algebra. Energy-based
	approaches have been extremely successful and the developed framework in this paper
	shares many of their desired properties such as the parallel structure on both CPUs
	and GPUs, sparsity, semi-dense tracking, avoiding explicit data association which is
	computationally expensive, and possible extensions to the simultaneous localization
	and mapping frameworks. The evaluations on experimental data and comparison with

  abstract  = {This paper derives a contact-aided inertial navigation observer for
	a 3D bipedal robot using the theory of invariant observer design.
	Aided inertial navigation is fundamentally a nonlinear observer design
	problem; thus, current solutions are based on approximations of the
	system dynamics, such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which uses
	a system's Jacobian linearization along the current best estimate
	of its trajectory. On the basis of the theory of invariant observer
	design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the Invariant EKF
	(InEKF), we show that the error dynamics of the point contact-inertial
	system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation; hence,
	the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a
	domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory.
	Due to the log-linear form of the error dynamics, it is not necessary
	to perform a nonlinear observability analysis to show that when using
	an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and contact sensors, the absolute
	position of the robot and a rotation about the gravity vector (yaw)
	are unobservable. We further augment the state of the developed InEKF
	with IMU biases, as the online estimation of these parameters has
	a crucial impact on system performance. We evaluate theconvergence
	of the proposed system with the commonly used quaternion-based EKF
	observer using a Monte-Carlo simulation. In addition, our experimental
	evaluation using a Cassie-series bipedal robot shows that the contact-aided
	InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based
	EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in the system dynamics.},

	good performance using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), cameras,
	and nonlinear optimization techniques, that they are now being deployed
	as technologies. However, many of these methods rely significantly
	on vision and often fail when visual tracking is lost due to lighting
	or scarcity of features. This paper presents a state-estimation technique
	for legged robots that takes into account the robot's kinematic model
	as well as its contact with the environment. We introduce forward
	kinematic factors and preintegrated contact factors into a factor
	graph framework that can be incrementally solved in real-time. The
	forward kinematic factor relates the robot's base pose to a contact
	frame through noisy encoder measurements. The preintegrated contact
	factor provides odometry measurements of this contact frame while
	accounting for possible foot slippage. Together, the two developed
	factors constrain the graph optimization problem allowing the robot's
	trajectory to be estimated. The paper evaluates the method using
	simulated and real sensory IMU and kinematic data from experiments
	with a Cassie-series robot designed by Agility Robotics. These preliminary
	experiments show that using the proposed method in addition to IMU
	decreases drift and improves localization accuracy, suggesting that
	its use can enable successful recovery from a loss of visual tracking.},

The dense depth prediction from a monocular image is supervised using sparse LIDAR points, which enables us to leverage available open source datasets with camera-LIDAR sensor suites during training. Currently, accurate and affordable range sensor is not readily available. Stereo cameras and LIDARs measure depth either inaccurately or sparsely/costly. In contrast to the current point-to-point loss evaluation approach, the proposed 3D loss treats point clouds as continuous objects; therefore, it compensates for the lack of dense ground truth depth due to LIDAR's sparsity measurements. We applied the proposed loss in three state-of-the-art monocular depth prediction approaches DORN, BTS, and Monodepth2. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed loss improves the depth prediction accuracy and produces point-clouds with more consistent 3D geometric structures compared with all tested baselines, implying the benefit of the proposed loss on general depth prediction networks.

  abstract  = {This work develops a learning-based contact estimator for legged robots that bypasses the need for physical sensors and takes multi-modal proprioceptive sensory data as input. Unlike vision-based state estimators, proprioceptive state estimators are agnostic to perceptually degraded situations such as dark or foggy scenes. While some robots are equipped with dedicated physical sensors to detect necessary contact data for state estimation, some robots do not have dedicated contact sensors, and the addition of such sensors is non-trivial without redesigning the hardware. The trained network can estimate contact events on different terrains. The experiments show that a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter can generate accurate odometry trajectories compared to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system, enabling robust proprioceptive odometry.},

The proposed method is built on the fast LK algorithm, which estimates the disparity of the stereo images patch-wisely and in a coarse-to-fine manner. We propose a Bayesian framework to evaluate the probability of the optimized patch disparity at different scales. Moreover, we introduce a spatial Gaussian mixed probability distribution to address the pixel-wise probability within the patch. In-vivo and synthetic experiments show that our method can handle ambiguities resulted from the textureless surfaces and the photometric inconsistency caused by the non-Lambertian reflectance. Our Bayesian method correctly balances the probability of the patch for stereo images at different scales. Experiments indicate that the estimated depth has similar accuracy and fewer outliers than the baseline methods in the surgical scenario with real-time performance.

We learn an embedding for each point cloud in a feature space that preserves the SO(3)-equivariance property, enabled by recent developments in equivariant neural networks. The proposed shape registration method achieves three major advantages through combining equivariant feature learning with implicit shape models. First, the necessity of data association is removed because of the permutation-invariant property in network architectures similar to PointNet. Second, the registration in feature space can be solved in closed-form using Horn’s method due to the SO(3)-equivariance property. Third, the registration is robust to noise in the point cloud because of the joint training of registration and implicit shape reconstruction. The experimental results show superior performance compared with existing correspondence-free deep registration methods.},

Providers, Clients, and Robots share an actionable and intuitive representation of the environment to create plans that best satisfy the combined needs of all parties. The plans are formed via interaction between the Client and the Robot based on a previously built multi-modal navigation graph. The explainable environmental representation in the form of a navigation graph is constructed collaboratively between Providers and Robots prior to interaction with Clients. We develop a realization of the proposed framework to create a spatial-semantic representation of an indoor environment autonomously. Moreover, we develop a planner that takes in constraints from Providers and Clients of the establishment and dynamically plans a sequence of visits to each area of interest. Evaluations show that the proposed realization of the PCR framework can successfully make plans while satisfying the specified time budget and sequence constraints and outperforming the greedy baseline.},

  abstract  = {Ultra-Local Models (ULM) have been applied to perform model-free control of nonlinear systems with unknown or partially known dynamics. Unfortunately, extending these methods to MIMO systems requires designing a dense input influence matrix which is challenging. This paper presents guidelines for designing an input influence matrix for discretetime, control-affine MIMO systems using an ULM-based controller. This paper analyzes the case that uses ULM and a model-free control scheme: the Hölder-continuous Finite-Time Stable (FTS) control. By comparing the ULM with the actual system dynamics, the paper describes how to extract the input-dependent part from the lumped ULM dynamics and finds that the tracking and state estimation error are coupled. The stability of the ULM-FTS error dynamics is affected by the eigenvalues of the difference (defined by matrix multiplication) between the actual and designed input influence matrix. Finally, the paper shows that a wide range of input influence matrix designs can keep the ULM-FTS error dynamics (at least locally) asymptotically stable. A numerical simulation is included to verify the result. The analysis can also be extended to other ULM-based controllers.},

The linearized tracking error dynamics and the linearized equations of motion are derived in the Lie algebra. Moreover, given an initial condition, the linearized tracking error dynamics and equations of motion are globally valid and evolve independently of the system trajectory. By exploiting the symmetry of the problem, the proposed approach shows faster convergence of rotation and position simultaneously than the state-of-the-art geometric variational MPC based on variational-based linearization. Numerical simulation on tracking control of a fully-actuated 3D rigid body dynamics confirms the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the baselines.

  abstract  = {This paper presents a control framework on Lie groups by designing the control objective in its Lie algebra. Control on Lie groups is challenging due to its nonlinear nature and difficulties in system parameterization. Existing methods to design the control objective on a Lie group and then derive the gradient for controller design are non-trivial and can result in slow convergence in tracking control. We show that with a proper left-invariant metric, setting the gradient of the cost function as the tracking error in the Lie algebra leads to a quadratic Lyapunov function that enables globally exponential convergence. In the PD control case, we show that our controller can maintain an exponential convergence rate even when the initial error is approaching $\pi$ in SO(3). We also show the merit of this proposed framework in trajectory optimization. The proposed cost function enables the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) to converge much faster than the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) with a well-adopted cost function when the initial trajectory is poorly initialized on SO(3).},

  year     = {2017},
  abstract = {Despite impressive advances in simultaneous localization and mapping, dense robotic mapping remains challenging due to its inherent nature of being a high-dimensional inference problem. In this paper, we propose a dense semantic robotic mapping technique that exploits sparse Bayesian models, in particular, the relevance vector machine, for high-dimensional sequential inference. The technique is based on the principle of automatic relevance determination and produces sparse models that use a small subset of the original dense training set as the dominant basis. The resulting map posterior is continuous, and queries can be made efficiently at any resolution. Moreover, the technique has probabilistic outputs per semantic class through Bayesian inference. We evaluate the proposed relevance vector semantic map using publicly available benchmark datasets, NYU Depth V2 and KITTI; and the results show promising improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

  abstract = {This paper reports on a robust RGB-D SLAM system that performs well in scarcely textured and structured environments. We present a novel keyframe-based continuous visual odometry that builds on the recently developed continuous sensor registration framework. A joint geometric and appearance representation is the result of transforming the RGB-D images into functions that live in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We solve both registration and keyframe selection problems via the inner product structure available in the RKHS. We also extend the proposed keyframe-based odometry method to a SLAM system using indirect ORB loop-closure constraints. The experimental evaluations using publicly available RGB-D benchmarks show that the developed keyframe selection technique using continuous visual odometry outperforms its robust dense (and direct) visual odometry equivalent. In addition, the developed SLAM system has better generalization across different training and validation sequences; it is robust to the lack of texture and structure in the scene; and shows comparable performance with the state-of-the-art SLAM systems.},

  title    = {Adaptive Continuous Visual Odometry from RGB-D Images},
  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the recently developed continuous visual odometry framework for RGB-D cameras to an adaptive framework via online hyperparameter learning. We focus on the case of isotropic kernels with a scalar as the length-scale. In practice and as expected, the length-scale has remarkable impacts on the performance of the original framework. Previously it was handled using a fixed set of conditions within the solver to reduce the length-scale as the algorithm reaches a local minimum. We automate this process by a greedy gradient descent step at each iteration to find the next-best length-scale. Furthermore, to handle failure cases in the gradient descent step where the gradient is not well-behaved, such as the absence of structure or texture in the scene, we use a search interval for the length-scale and guide it gradually toward the smaller values. This latter strategy reverts the adaptive framework to the original setup. The experimental evaluations using publicly available RGB-D benchmarks show the proposed adaptive continuous visual odometry outperforms the original framework and the current state-of-the-art. We also make the software for the developed algorithm publicly available.},

  abstract      = {This paper reports on developing an integrated framework for safety-aware informative motion planning suitable for legged robots. The information-gathering planner takes a dense stochastic map of the environment into account, while safety constraints are enforced via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The planner is based on the Incrementally-exploring Information Gathering (IIG) algorithm and allows closed-loop kinodynamic node expansion using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formalism. Robotic exploration and information gathering problems are inherently path-dependent problems. That is, the information collected along a path depends on the state and observation history. As such, motion planning solely based on a modular cost does not lead to suitable plans for exploration. We propose SAFE-IIG, an integrated informative motion planning algorithm that takes into account: 1) a robot's perceptual field of view via a submodular information function computed over a stochastic map of the environment, 2) a robot's dynamics and safety constraints via discrete-time CBFs and MPC for closed-loop multi-horizon node expansions, and 3) an automatic stopping criterion via setting an information-theoretic planning horizon. The simulation results show that SAFE-IIG can plan a safe and dynamically feasible path while exploring a dense map.},

Path-dependent problems frequently appear in robotics and artificial intelligence, where the state such as a map is partially observable, and information can only be obtained along a trajectory by local sensing.

  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Sensor calibration, which can be intrinsic or extrinsic, is an essential step to achieve the measurement accuracy required for modern perception and navigation systems deployed on autonomous robots. To date, intrinsic calibration models for spinning LiDARs have been based on hypothesized based on their physical mechanisms, resulting in anywhere from three to ten parameters to be estimated from data, while no phenomenological models have yet been proposed for solid-state LiDARs. Instead of going down that road, we propose to abstract away from the physics of a LiDAR type (spinning vs solid-state, for example), and focus on the spatial geometry of the point cloud generated by the sensor. By modeling the calibration parameters as an element of a special matrix Lie Group, we achieve a unifying view of calibration for different types of LiDARs. We further prove mathematically that the proposed model is well-constrained (has a unique answer) given four appropriately orientated targets. The proof provides a guideline for target positioning in the form of a tetrahedron. Moreover, an existing Semidefinite programming global solver for SE(3) can be modified to compute efficiently the optimal calibration parameters. For solid state LiDARs, we illustrate how the method works in simulation. For spinning LiDARs, we show with experimental data that the proposed matrix Lie Group model performs equally well as physics-based models in terms of reducing the P2P distance, while being more robust to noise.},
