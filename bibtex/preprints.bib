  year     = {2017},
  abstract = {Despite impressive advances in simultaneous localization and mapping, dense robotic mapping remains challenging due to its inherent nature of being a high-dimensional inference problem. In this paper, we propose a dense semantic robotic mapping technique that exploits sparse Bayesian models, in particular, the relevance vector machine, for high-dimensional sequential inference. The technique is based on the principle of automatic relevance determination and produces sparse models that use a small subset of the original dense training set as the dominant basis. The resulting map posterior is continuous, and queries can be made efficiently at any resolution. Moreover, the technique has probabilistic outputs per semantic class through Bayesian inference. We evaluate the proposed relevance vector semantic map using publicly available benchmark datasets, NYU Depth V2 and KITTI; and the results show promising improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {This paper reports on a robust RGB-D SLAM system that performs well in scarcely textured and structured environments. We present a novel keyframe-based continuous visual odometry that builds on the recently developed continuous sensor registration framework. A joint geometric and appearance representation is the result of transforming the RGB-D images into functions that live in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We solve both registration and keyframe selection problems via the inner product structure available in the RKHS. We also extend the proposed keyframe-based odometry method to a SLAM system using indirect ORB loop-closure constraints. The experimental evaluations using publicly available RGB-D benchmarks show that the developed keyframe selection technique using continuous visual odometry outperforms its robust dense (and direct) visual odometry equivalent. In addition, the developed SLAM system has better generalization across different training and validation sequences; it is robust to the lack of texture and structure in the scene; and shows comparable performance with the state-of-the-art SLAM systems.},

  title    = {Adaptive Continuous Visual Odometry from RGB-D Images},
  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {In this paper, we extend the recently developed continuous visual odometry framework for RGB-D cameras to an adaptive framework via online hyperparameter learning. We focus on the case of isotropic kernels with a scalar as the length-scale. In practice and as expected, the length-scale has remarkable impacts on the performance of the original framework. Previously it was handled using a fixed set of conditions within the solver to reduce the length-scale as the algorithm reaches a local minimum. We automate this process by a greedy gradient descent step at each iteration to find the next-best length-scale. Furthermore, to handle failure cases in the gradient descent step where the gradient is not well-behaved, such as the absence of structure or texture in the scene, we use a search interval for the length-scale and guide it gradually toward the smaller values. This latter strategy reverts the adaptive framework to the original setup. The experimental evaluations using publicly available RGB-D benchmarks show the proposed adaptive continuous visual odometry outperforms the original framework and the current state-of-the-art. We also make the software for the developed algorithm publicly available.},

  abstract      = {This paper reports on developing an integrated framework for safety-aware informative motion planning suitable for legged robots. The information-gathering planner takes a dense stochastic map of the environment into account, while safety constraints are enforced via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The planner is based on the Incrementally-exploring Information Gathering (IIG) algorithm and allows closed-loop kinodynamic node expansion using a Model Predictive Control (MPC) formalism. Robotic exploration and information gathering problems are inherently path-dependent problems. That is, the information collected along a path depends on the state and observation history. As such, motion planning solely based on a modular cost does not lead to suitable plans for exploration. We propose SAFE-IIG, an integrated informative motion planning algorithm that takes into account: 1) a robot's perceptual field of view via a submodular information function computed over a stochastic map of the environment, 2) a robot's dynamics and safety constraints via discrete-time CBFs and MPC for closed-loop multi-horizon node expansions, and 3) an automatic stopping criterion via setting an information-theoretic planning horizon. The simulation results show that SAFE-IIG can plan a safe and dynamically feasible path while exploring a dense map.},

  abstract      = {Information gathered along a path is inherently submodular; the incremental amount of information gained along a path decreases due to redundant observations. In addition to submodularity, the incremental amount of information gained is a function of not only the current state but also the entire history as well. This paper presents the construction of the first-order necessary optimality conditions for memory (history-dependent) Lagrangians. Path-dependent problems frequently appear in robotics and artificial intelligence, where the state such as a map is partially observable, and information can only be obtained along a trajectory by local sensing. Robotic exploration and environmental monitoring has numerous real-world applications and can be formulated using the proposed approach.},

  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Sensor calibration, which can be intrinsic or extrinsic, is an essential step to achieve the measurement accuracy required for modern perception and navigation systems deployed on autonomous robots. To date, intrinsic calibration models for spinning LiDARs have been based on hypothesized based on their physical mechanisms, resulting in anywhere from three to ten parameters to be estimated from data, while no phenomenological models have yet been proposed for solid-state LiDARs. Instead of going down that road, we propose to abstract away from the physics of a LiDAR type (spinning vs solid-state, for example), and focus on the spatial geometry of the point cloud generated by the sensor. By modeling the calibration parameters as an element of a special matrix Lie Group, we achieve a unifying view of calibration for different types of LiDARs. We further prove mathematically that the proposed model is well-constrained (has a unique answer) given four appropriately orientated targets. The proof provides a guideline for target positioning in the form of a tetrahedron. Moreover, an existing Semidefinite programming global solver for SE(3) can be modified to compute efficiently the optimal calibration parameters. For solid state LiDARs, we illustrate how the method works in simulation. For spinning LiDARs, we show with experimental data that the proposed matrix Lie Group model performs equally well as physics-based models in terms of reducing the P2P distance, while being more robust to noise.},
