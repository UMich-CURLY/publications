  abstract  = {WiFi technology has been used pervasively in fine-grained indoor localization,
	gesture recognition, and adaptive communication. Achieving better performance in these 
	tasks generally boils down to differentiating Line-Of-Sight (LOS) from Non-Line-Of-Sight
	(NLOS) signal propagation reliably which generally requires expensive/specialized 
	hardware due to the complex nature of indoor environments. Hence, the development of
	low-cost accurate positioning systems that exploit available infrastructure is not
	entirely solved. In this paper, we develop a framework for indoor localization and
	tracking of ubiquitous mobile devices such as smartphones using on-board sensors.
	We present a novel deep LOS/NLOS classifier which uses the Received Signal Strength

  abstract  = {The factor graph framework is a convenient modeling technique for
	robotic state estimation where states are represented as nodes, and
	measurements are modeled as factors. When designing a sensor fusion
	framework for legged robots, one often has access to visual, inertial,
	joint encoder, and contact sensors. While visual-inertial odometry
	has been studied extensively in this framework, the addition of a
	preintegrated contact factor for legged robots has been only recently
	proposed. This allowed for integration of encoder and contact measurements
	into existing factor graphs, however, new nodes had to be added to
	the graph every time contact was made or broken. In this work, to
	cope with the problem of switching contact frames, we propose a hybrid
	contact preintegration theory that allows contact information to
	be integrated through an arbitrary number of contact switches. The
	proposed hybrid modeling approach reduces the number of required
	variables in the nonlinear optimization problem by only requiring
	new states to be added alongside camera or selected keyframes. This
	method is evaluated using real experimental data collected from a
	Cassie-series robot where the trajectory of the robot produced by
	a motion capture system is used as a proxy for ground truth. The
	evaluation shows that inclusion of the proposed preintegrated hybrid
	contact factor alongside visual-inertial navigation systems improves
	estimation accuracy as well as robustness to vision failure, while
	its generalization makes it more accessible for legged platforms.},

	is achieved through functional treatment of the problem and representing the

	Aided inertial navigation is fundamentally a nonlinear observer design
	problem; thus, current solutions are based on approximations of the
	system dynamics, such as an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), which uses
	a system's Jacobian linearization along the current best estimate
	of its trajectory. On the basis of the theory of invariant observer
	design by Barrau and Bonnabel, and in particular, the Invariant EKF
	(InEKF), we show that the error dynamics of the point contact-inertial
	system follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation; hence,
	the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a
	domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory.
	Due to the log-linear form of the error dynamics, it is not necessary
	to perform a nonlinear observability analysis to show that when using
	an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and contact sensors, the absolute
	position of the robot and a rotation about the gravity vector (yaw)
	are unobservable. We further augment the state of the developed InEKF
	with IMU biases, as the online estimation of these parameters has
	a crucial impact on system performance. We evaluate theconvergence
	of the proposed system with the commonly used quaternion-based EKF
	observer using a Monte-Carlo simulation. In addition, our experimental
	evaluation using a Cassie-series bipedal robot shows that the contact-aided
	InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based
	EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in the system dynamics.},

Currently, accurate and affordable range sensor is not readily available. Stereo cameras and LIDARs measure depth either inaccurately or sparsely/costly. In contrast to the current point-to-point loss evaluation approach, the proposed 3D loss treats point clouds as continuous objects; therefore, it compensates for the lack of dense ground truth depth due to LIDAR's sparsity measurements. We applied the proposed loss in three state-of-the-art monocular depth prediction approaches DORN, BTS, and Monodepth2. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed loss improves the depth prediction accuracy and produces point-clouds with more consistent 3D geometric structures compared with all tested baselines, implying the benefit of the proposed loss on general depth prediction networks.

Our Bayesian method correctly balances the probability of the patch for stereo images at different scales.

Second, the registration in feature space can be solved in closed-form using Horn’s method due to the SO(3)-equivariance property. Third, the registration is robust to noise in the point cloud because of the joint training of registration and implicit shape reconstruction. The experimental results show superior performance compared with existing correspondence-free deep registration methods.},

  abstract  = {This paper develops a novel framework called Providers-Clients-Robots (PCR), applicable to socially assistive robots that support research on shared understanding in human-robot interactions. Providers, Clients, and Robots share an actionable and intuitive representation of the environment to create plans that best satisfy the combined needs of all parties. The plans are formed via interaction between the Client and the Robot based on a previously built multi-modal navigation graph. The explainable environmental representation in the form of a navigation graph is constructed collaboratively between Providers and Robots prior to interaction with Clients. We develop a realization of the proposed framework to create a spatial-semantic representation of an indoor environment autonomously. Moreover, we develop a planner that takes in constraints from Providers and Clients of the establishment and dynamically plans a sequence of visits to each area of interest. Evaluations show that the proposed realization of the PCR framework can successfully make plans while satisfying the specified time budget and sequence constraints and outperforming the greedy baseline.},

  year      = {2022},
  pages     = {2730-2735},
  abstract  = {Ultra-Local Models (ULM) have been applied to perform model-free control of nonlinear systems with unknown or partially known dynamics. Unfortunately, extending these methods to MIMO systems requires designing a dense input influence matrix which is challenging. This paper presents guidelines for designing an input influence matrix for discretetime, control-affine MIMO systems using an ULM-based controller. This paper analyzes the case that uses ULM and a model-free control scheme: the Hölder-continuous Finite-Time Stable (FTS) control. By comparing the ULM with the actual system dynamics, the paper describes how to extract the input-dependent part from the lumped ULM dynamics and finds that the tracking and state estimation error are coupled. The stability of the ULM-FTS error dynamics is affected by the eigenvalues of the difference (defined by matrix multiplication) between the actual and designed input influence matrix. Finally, the paper shows that a wide range of input influence matrix designs can keep the ULM-FTS error dynamics (at least locally) asymptotically stable. A numerical simulation is included to verify the result. The analysis can also be extended to other ULM-based controllers.},

  year      = {2022},
  pages     = {1-8},
  abstract  = {This paper reports on a new error-state Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to connected matrix Lie groups for robot control. The linearized tracking error dynamics and the linearized equations of motion are derived in the Lie algebra. Moreover, given an initial condition, the linearized tracking error dynamics and equations of motion are globally valid and evolve independently of the system trajectory. By exploiting the symmetry of the problem, the proposed approach shows faster convergence of rotation and position simultaneously than the state-of-the-art geometric variational MPC based on variational-based linearization. Numerical simulation on tracking control of a fully-actuated 3D rigid body dynamics confirms the benefits of the proposed approach compared to the baselines. Furthermore, the proposed MPC is also verified in pose control and locomotion experiments on a quadrupedal robot MIT Mini Cheetah.},

  year      = {2022},
  pages     = {1-8},
  abstract  = {This paper presents a control framework on Lie groups by designing the control objective in its Lie algebra. Control on Lie groups is challenging due to its nonlinear nature and difficulties in system parameterization. Existing methods to design the control objective on a Lie group and then derive the gradient for controller design are non-trivial and can result in slow convergence in tracking control. We show that with a proper left-invariant metric, setting the gradient of the cost function as the tracking error in the Lie algebra leads to a quadratic Lyapunov function that enables globally exponential convergence. In the PD control case, we show that our controller can maintain an exponential convergence rate even when the initial error is approaching $\pi$ in SO(3). We also show the merit of this proposed framework in trajectory optimization. The proposed cost function enables the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) to converge much faster than the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) with a well-adopted cost function when the initial trajectory is poorly initialized on SO(3).},
